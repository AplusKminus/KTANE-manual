\rhead{Defusing Bombs}
A bomb will explode when its countdown timer reaches 0:00 or when too many strikes have been recorded.
The only way to defuse a bomb is to disarm all of its modules before its countdown timer expires.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Modules}
Each bomb will include one or several modules that must be disarmed.
Each module is discrete, but some modules require to be solved before others.


\subsubsection*{Strikes}

  Strike Indicator

  \label{fig:Strikes}
\end{wrapfigure}
When the Defuser makes a mistake the bomb will record a strike which will be displayed on the indicator above the countdown timer.
Bombs with a strike indicator will explode upon the third strike.
The timer will begin to count down faster after a strike has been recorded.

If no strike indicator is present above the countdown timer, the bomb will explode upon the first strike, leaving no room for error.

\subsubsection*{Gathering Information}
Some disarming instructions will require specific information about the bomb, such as the serial number.
For detailed descriptions see the next page "On the Subject of Edgework".

\section*{On the Subject of Edgework}
\rhead{Edgework}
The term edgework describes all kinds of widgets that can be found on the side casings of a bomb.
The different kinds and their meanings are described in the following sections.
Many modules ask for specific information about the edgework.

\subsubsection*{Serial Number}
\begin{wraptable}[4]{r}{0.22\textwidth}
  \vspace{-2\baselineskip}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{| c |}
    \hline
    \color{white}
    \cellcolor{red}
    Serial \#
    \\ \hline
    \marginbox{0.3cm}{\huge{I6K3NP}}
    \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}\label{tab:serial_section}
\end{wraptable}
The serial number is a code of six symbols and is made up of uppercase letters and digits.
There is always at least one digit in the serial number.
A zero has a diagonal line crossing through it, while the letter O does not.

\subsubsection*{Indicator Lights}
\begin{wrapfigure}[3]{r}{0.251\textwidth} %this figure will be at the right
  \vspace{-2\baselineskip}
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \coordinate (dm1) at (2,0.6);
    \coordinate (dm2) at (-2,-0.6);
    \coordinate (dm3) at (-1.5,0);
    \coordinate (dm4) at (-1,0);
    \coordinate (dm5) at (1.8,0.6);
    \coordinate (dm6) at (0,0);
    \node[rectangle,draw,fill=red] [fit = (dm1) (dm2)] (bx4) {};
    \node[circle,draw=lightgray,line width=2.5,fill=white] [fit = (dm3) (dm4)] (circle) {};
    \node[rectangle,draw, fill=black] [fit = (dm5) (dm6)] (bx4) [right=0.4cm of circle] {};
    \node[align=center,font=\large,color=white] at (bx4.center) {BOB};
%        \draw [black, fill=red, align=center] (2,1) rectangle (-1,-1) node [black] {\centering Start}; % Draws a rectangle
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}
Indicator lights can be lit or unlit and are accompanied by a three-letter code.
Common codes include:

BOB, CAR, CLR, FRK, FRQ, IND, MSA, NSA, SIG, SND, TRN

\subsubsection*{Batteries}
\begin{wraptable}[4]{r}{0.28\textwidth}
  \vspace{-2\baselineskip}

    \marginbox{0.1cm}{\includegraphics[width=1.8cm]{images/battery_d}}
    \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{wraptable}
There are two types of batteries that can occur on a bomb.
They are always placed in battery holders.
A holder contains two AA batteries or one D battery.
For some modules the number of holders is relevant.

\subsubsection*{Ports}
There are six types of ports that can occur on a bomb.
Note that the stereo RCA port consists of two individual sockets, one white and one red, but both together count as a single port only.
