  It's hard to say how this mechanism works. The engineering is pretty impressive, but there must have been an easier way to manage nine wires.
}
  \begin{bulletlist}
    \bulletitem{Within this module there are several panels with wires on them, but only one panel is visible at a time. Switch to the next panel by usihng the down button and the previous panel by using the up button.}
    \bulletitem{Do not switch to the next panel until you are sure that you have cut all necessary wires on the current panel.}
    \bulletitem{Cut the wires as directed by the following tables. Wire occurrences are cumulative over all panels within the module.}
    \bulletitem{Wire occurrences are counted per color, so the first red wire you encounter is the first red wire occurrence, even if there was a blue wire before it.}
    \bulletitem{The wires should be assessed from top to bottom when looking at the numbers on the left, regardless of whether the wire itself goes up or down.}
    \bulletitem{Hint: Walk through the module together with the defuser while keeping the position for each color with one finger in each table.}
